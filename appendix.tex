\subsection{Azimuthal Dependence of Trigger Efficiencies}

While azimuthal dependence of trigger efficiencies are typically averaged over,
there is still value in observing any potential azimuthal dependence. To mimic
the half-octant structure of the Muon Tracker and the RPCs, 16 bins were
assigned based on the PHENIX coordinate system. Here only the most striking
results will be shown. Most importantly a clear $\phi$ dependence was observed
in the South 1D triggers at intermediate rapidities as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:run13_trigeffiphi_trig17}.

The RPC1+3 triggers alone, bits 18 and 19 also show generally a rather
homogeneous efficiency as a function of rapdity. However, two half-octants in
the North seem to be substantially less efficient as displayed in Fig.~

\chapter{Rate Dependence of Trigger Efficiencies}
The rate dependence is of muon production triggers is again mostly included in
the overall trigger efficiencies as long as the sampled raw rates are not too
different between the ERT, MPC, MinBias and 1D triggers. They might explain some
of the differences seen between those triggers samples, as for example the 1D,
ERT and MPC triggers might sample preferrably at lower rates where their
prescales are smaller. However, these effects are only higher order effects
taken care of by assigning differences between reference samples as systematic
uncertainty on the overall trigger efficiency. 

Nevertheless it is of interest to see, whether the different triggers in the $W$
candidate event sample do behave differently as a function of rate. It has been
shown before, that the 1D trigger in the setting in Run 11 and 12 (pp) does show
declining efficiencies as the collision rates increase.  This behavior can be
confirmed in Run13 as shown in Fig.~ \ref{fig:run13_trigeffirate_trig17}.

\clearpage

What is a little surprising, is that there exist some triggers whose
efficiencies increase as a function of rate, for example the SG1 triggers as
shown in Fig.~ \ref{fig:run13_trigeffirate_trig2425} for the intermediate
rapidity range, but high and low rapidities behave similar. Apparently the
trigger rejections drop and more and more candidate tracks are picked up by this
trigger including tracks in the wrong arm for which the efficiencies are
initially zero but with slopes that are much steeper as for the actually
triggered arm.

This rising SG1 behavior is then somewhat mirrored in some of the other triggers
related to SG1 with the exception of the North RPC13\_BC trigger where the
trigger efficiency is nearly flat or slightly falling, see Fig.~

As a potential alternative the high $W_{ness}$ ($W_{ness}$ $>$0.92), eta dependent efficiencies are taken for the total eta dependent efficiencies as shown in Fig.~ \ref{fig:totaltrigeffi_all_wpt4}. As those require smaller minimum $p_T$, their efficiencies are mostly slightly smaller than those obtained in Fig.~ \ref{fig:totaltrigeffi_all_wpt3}, but their finer eta binning takes the varying trigger acceptances better into account and discontinuities such as seen at around rapidities of 2 (due to the overlapping 13\_BD and 3A acceptances) disappear. 
Both values are given below as final results and are both used when applying them to the muon background simulations or to extract cross sections.

\chapter{Systematic Studies--$A_L$}
\label{appendix_1}

Systematic studies have been done to study the reconstruction of the single spin
asymmetries, and the sensitivity of this reconstruction to various potential
systematic effects. These studies are reproduced from~\cite{Seidl2014a}

\section{Combined systematic studies}
Using the data-based signal to background extraction in the way introduced in
\cite{Oide2012} the resulting background corrected asymmetries are significantly
inconsistent with any of the parameterizations. The up and down quark
polarizations are generally well enough known, as are the W kinematics, that
there is little doubt in the asymmetries mostly related to them, namely the
forward $W^-\rightarrow \mu^-$ asymmetries and the backward
$W^+\rightarrow\mu^+$ asymmetries. It seems therefore much more likely, that
either a statistical fluctuation or analysis error creates the resulting
discrepancies. When taking the signal to background values at face value a
statistical fluctuation is essentially excluded, however, if there is a
significant overestimation of these ratios it could still be possible. 

In order to understand the origins of the data parameterization discrepancy
better we are studying the asymmetries and the signal to background ratios as a
function of various relevant variables. In most cases the background corrected
asymmetries as well as the signal to background ratios are displayed together to
give a better idea of the impact on the background. Either the data-based or
W-MC based signal to background ratios are displayed and used to see the
difference it makes.

\subsection{Asymmetries as function of W selection and deflection angular bands}

As the asymmetry calculation only uses the $dw_{23}$ region with supposedly W support
the whole region and the inverse selection are also of interest. As the inverse
region is expected to be dominated by more background its asymmetries should be
closer to zero as only the W/Z production gives parity violating asymmetries.
However, it seems, that while statistical uncertainties are generally larger the
asymmetries have a tendency to be nonzero in particular also the double spin
asymmetries. This could either be an indication of remaining signal in the
sidebands or some remaining background asymmetries. The Asymmetries in the
$dw_{23}$ sidebands can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:dwcuts}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    symbols) beams and $\epsilon_{LL}$ (black symbols) for both arms and charges as

    bin after selecting the {\bf sideband} $dw_{23}$ region is displayed. In addition the
    extracted signal to background ratios are displayed using the right-hand axis
    values. The green line displays the data-based extraction method while the
    magenta line represents the MC signal based extraction.\label{fig:dwcuts}
  }

\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsection{Asymmetries and Signal to BG ratio as a function of rate, time and transverse momentum range}
Another important test is whether the asymmetries show any kind of rate or run
dependence effect. For this purpose the data was split up into three rapidity
ranges with about equal luminosity: The multi-collision parameters were chosen
as 0, 0.69, 0.83, 2. Naively a rate dependent effect would result in a certain
ordering of the asymmetries with either increasing or decreasing asymmetries as
the rates increase. All the asymmetries as a function of minimum $W_{ness}$ cut are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:rateranges}. Out of the 12 different asymmetries ( arm x charge x singe,double spin asymmetry) a few display such a behavior while the majority appears to be randomly distributed between the different rates.

In addition the extracted signal to background ratios are displayed using the right-hand axis values. The green line displays the data-based extraction method while the magenta line represents the MC signal based extraction.\label{fig:rateranges}}

\end{figure}
\clearpage

A t-test between low and high to intermediate rates was performed and the distribution is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:raterangest}. The amount of larger differences is on the order expected for statistical fluctuations around an average value and therefore one can conclude, that no obvious rate dependent effect is visible.   
\begin{figure}[h!]

  \centering

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{./figures/tscores13_wness_16_60_dw6}.png}
  \caption{Student T scores and distribution when comparing the lot to medium and the low to high rate subset.\label{fig:raterangest}}

\end{figure}
\clearpage

Similarly, the run dependence was studied in three range bins from 0, 392276, 395770, 399000. While some correlation with the rates is likely, it should be mostly washed out as the collision rates decrease within fills. With the run dependence it would be possible to see, if time dependent detector or accelerator related effects bias the results in some way. 
The resulting asymmetries can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:runranges} and the
corresponding t-test between low, high and mid run ranges is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:runrangest}. Again, while some asymmetries show a range dependence
the overall distribution of differences as consistent with fluctuations only.

In addition the extracted signal to background ratios are displayed using the right-hand axis values.

\end{figure}
\clearpage


Another test is the dependence on the minimum transverse momentum cut or the transverse momentum range selected. As mentioned earlier in this analysis note the W and Z decay muons dominate at larger transverse momenta while at lower transverse momenta even more dilution from other muon processes and fake hadrons contribute. As a consequence any asymmetry should be largely diluted and start to appear as the minimum transverse momentum cut is increased. 
Such a behavior can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:minptasymmetries} where essentially all asymmetries are consistent with zero at low transverse momenta and then increase in some of the cases. What appears different than expectation is the signal to background ratio obtained from the fits. The signal to background ratios from the fits seem to be not increasing while the MC based signal to background ratios show the expected behavior.

The green line displays the data-based extraction method while the magenta line represents the MC signal based extraction.\label{fig:minptasymmetries}}

\end{figure}
\clearpage

The asymmetries in ranges of transverse momenta are shown in Fig.~
\ref{fig:rangeptasymmetries}. After small initial asymmetries they are mostly
consistent at intermediate transverse momentum ranges and only seem to change
again at transverse momenta of around 18. The signal-to-background distribution
is again unexpected as obtained from the fits while it is more consistent with
expectations in the MC based extraction.

\end{figure}
\clearpage


\subsection{Addition of artificial MC-based signal and asymmetries}
Another type of test uses the generated signal MC and includes a fraction of it
into the data set before calculating asymmetries and signal to background
ratios. In order to do so, crossings are assigned randomly to the MC such, that a
certain set of asymmetries can be generated. As an initial test only constant
asymmetries were generated. Not any asymmetries can be physically created as the
yields in the 4 helicity combinations need to non-negative. The double spin
asymmetries need to be within a certain range of the other two.  
The initial asymmetries created were 40\% and 10\% for the negative generated
muons and -20\% and -30\% for the positive generated muons while no double spin
asymmetries were generated.

The resulting asymmetries and signal-to-background ratios are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:mcadd1} for an MC admixture of 20 fb$^{-1}$ as a function of the minimum $W_{ness}$ cut. One can see, that with increasing minimum $W_{ness}$ the resulting asymmetries begin to increase as expected while the generally fall short of the generated asymmetries. In Fig.~\ref{fig:mcadd3} the asymmetries and signal-to-background ratios are displayed as a function of the MC admixture. Also the background corrected asymmetries are displayed which should return the generated asymmetries with the exception of the actual signal based asymmetries in the actual data.   
As one can see, the asymmetries are not properly recovered especially at low admixtures. While part of it could be coming from the Physics asymmetries its contribution should be small. Again, using the MC based signal to background ratios seem to better recover the generated asymmetries.

\subsection{Checking the relative luminosities between patterns}
In the previous evaluation of the asymmetries we were implicitly assuming that we took the same luminosity for every spin pattern.
To make sure this is the case, we explicitly counted the scalers from the spin Data Base from the entry ScalerBbcNoCut for each spin pattern and we found the following:
%\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  Spin Pattern (Blue, Yellow) & \\
  \hline 
  +1, +1 & 5.29+11\\
  -1, +1 & 5.28e+11\\
  +1, -1 & 5.29e+11\\
  -1, -1 & 5.29e+11.\\
  \hline 
  %\caption{Scalers count for every spin pattern.}
\end{tabular}

%\end{table}
As can be seen in the previous table, there is only a 0.2\% difference between the luminosity of the spin patterns,
so the previous assumption that there are no differences in luminosities between spin patterns is safe. As a double check,
we rescaled the yield for each spin pattern according to the scalers just reported, and as expected no significant differences
were observed in the combined asymmetries, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:asyscaled}.
