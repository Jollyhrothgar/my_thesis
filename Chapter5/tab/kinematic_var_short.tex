			$\eta$               & Pseudorapidity, used in secondary likelihood cuts \\
			$\chi^{2}_{track}$   & Standard chi2 of $\mu$ track Kalman fitter\\
			$DG0$,$DDG0$         & Roads generated in MUID+MuTr planes. $DG0$ is distance between first gap road and track. $DDG0$ is opening angle between road and track. \\
			$DCA_r$,$DCA_Z$      & Distance of closest approach between $\mu$ track and beam axis ($DCA_r$). $DCA_Z$ is the distance between the track's intersection with PHENIX's z-axis and the event vertex. \\
			$RpcDca_{1,3}$       & Distance between extrapolated track at RPC 1 or 3, and hit cluster at RPC 1 or 3. \\
			$dw_{23}$            & Reduced azimuthal bending angle of track. $dw_{23} = p_T sin(\theta)(\phi_2-\phi_3)$ \\
