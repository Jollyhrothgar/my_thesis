  \textit{
	Some say that it takes a village to raise a child. The same can be said of
	raising a graduate student up to earning a PhD. This thesis is dedicated to
	the multitude who have helped me become the man I am today, and to students
	who struggle, and their mentors who do not give up on them. \\
