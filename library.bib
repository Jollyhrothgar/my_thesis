abstract = {A recently completed next-to-leading-order program to calculate neutrino cross sections, including power-suppressed mass correction terms, has been applied to evaluate the Paschos-Wolfenstein relation, in order to quantitatively assess the validity and significance of the NuTeV anomaly. In particular, we study the shift of {\$}\backslashsin{\^{}}2 \backslashtheta{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}W{\}}{\}}{\$} obtained in calculations with a new generation of PDF sets that allow {\$}s(x)\backslashneq \backslashbar{\{}s{\}}(x){\$}, enabled by recent neutrino dimuon data from CCFR and NuTeV, as compared to the previous {\$}s = \backslashbar{\{}s{\}}{\$} parton distribution functions like CTEQ6M. The extracted value of {\$}\backslashsin{\^{}}2 \backslashtheta{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}W{\}}{\}}{\$} is closely correlated with the strangeness asymmetry momentum integral {\$}\backslashint{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\^{}}{\{}1{\}}x[s(x)-\backslashbar{\{}s{\}}(x)] dx{\$}. We also consider isospin violating effects that have recently been explored by the MRST group. The results of our study suggest that the new dimuon data, the Weinberg angle measurement, and other data sets used in global QCD parton structure analysis can all be consistent within the Standard Model.},

abstract = {A new model of the higher symmetry of elementary particles is introduced ln which the eight known baryons are treated as a supermultiplet, degenerate in the limit of unitary symmetry but split into isotopic spin multiplets by a symmetry-breaking term. The symmetry violation is ascribed phenomenologically to the mass differences. The baryons correspond to an eight-dimensional irreducible representation of the unitary group. The pion and K meson fit into a similar set of eight particles along with a predicted pseudoscalar meson X {\{}sup o{\}} having I = 0. A ninth vector meson coupled to the baryon current can be accommodated naturally in the scheme. It is predicted that the eight baryons should all have the same spin and parity and that pseudoscalar and vector mesons should form octets with possible additional singlets. The mathematics of the unitary group is described by considering three fictitious leptons, nu , e {\{}sup -{\}}, and mu {\{}sup -{\}}, which may throw light on the structure of weak interactions. (D.

abstract = {Hadron jets produced in e+e- annihilation between 13 GeV and 31.6 GeV in c.m. at PETRA are analyzed. The transverse momentum of the jets is found to increase strongly with c.m. energy. The broadening of the jets is not uniform in azimuthal angle around the quark direction but tends to yield planar events with large and growing transverse momenta in the plane and smaller transverse momenta normal to the plane. The simple qq collinear jet picture is ruled out. The observation of planar events shows that there are three basic particles in the final state. Indeed, several events with three well-separated jets of hadrons are observed at the highest energies. This occurs naturally when the outgoing quark radiates a hard noncollinear gluon, i.e., e+e- → qqg with the quarks and the gluons fragmenting into hadrons with limited transverse momenta. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

We first give an optimal $\Theta$ ( n log n ) algorithm for the general case. In the special case where the points in P are given in sorted order according to their x -coordinates, we give an optimal $\Theta$ ( n ) time algorithm. Then, we show how to solve the weighted version of this problem in time O ( n log 4 n ). Finally, we give an O ( n h 2 log h ) algorithm for the case where h outliers are allowed, and the input is sorted. The running time of all our algorithms is independent of k .},

abstract = {At the end of RHIC's 2009 operation a dedicated run for the PP2PP experiment (part of the STAR experiment) took place from Jun 29 to Jul 06 2009. Polarized protons were accelerated to 100 GeV using ramp-file pp100-90pp2pp with a $\beta$∗ = 22min IR6. Since only transverse polarization was required no rotator ramp was in use. The PP2PP experiment consists mainly of two Roman Pot detectors (one horizontal and one vertical) on either side of IR6 in the outgoing-beam arms between the Q3 and Q4 magnets. The yellow pots are in sector 5, the blue ones in sector 6. Roman Pot type detectors are installed inside the beampipe causing an accelerator safety concern. To address this concern there is a limit to the allowable total beam current in the machine while Roman Pots are enabled to move closer to the beam. This limit was set to a motion limit of 5 mm from the center of the beampipe and 50 {\textperiodcentered}1011 beam current per ring [1]. In order to reduce the background in the detectors, beams were scraped using the RHIC collimator system prior to moving the pots closer. This was typically repeated several times throughout a store since beam halo reforms over the course of hours. 2},

abstract = {This White Paper presents the science case of an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), focused on the structure and interactions of gluon-dominated matter, with the intent to articulate it to the broader nuclear science community. It was commissioned by the managements of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) with the objective of presenting a summary of scientific opportunities and goals of the EIC as a follow-up to the 2007 NSAC Long Range plan. This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on "Gluons and quark sea at high energies" at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required to achieve them, and it benefited from inputs from the users' communities of BNL and JLab. This White Paper offers the promise to propel the QCD science program in the U.S., established with the CEBAF accelerator at JLab and the RHIC collider at BNL, to the next QCD frontier.},

Over 140 000 Drell-Yan muon pairs with dimuon mass Mmu+mu- greater than or equal to 4.5 GeV/c(2) were recorded. From these data, the ratio of antidown ((d) over bar) to antiup ((u) over bar) quark distributions in the proton sea is determined over a wide range in Bjorken x. A strong x dependence is observed in the ratio (d) over bar/(u) over bar, showing substantial enhancement of (d) over bar with respect to (u) over bar for x {\textless} 0.2. This result is in fair agreement with recent parton distribution parametrizations of the sea. For x {\textgreater} 0.2, the observed (d) over bar/(u) over bar ratio is much nearer unity than given by the parametrizations.},

abstract = {The PHENIX experiment is one of the large detector projects at the Relativis- tic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. One of the unique features of the PHENIX detector is the muon tracking and identification system. No other RHIC experiment has a muon detection capability. Among the many physics topics explored by the observation of muons in Au-Au collisions are the effects of Debye screening on vector meson production, and the search for an enhancement in strangeness and heavy flavor production. In the collisions of polarized protons, the muon arms can explore the polarization of quarks and glu- ons in the proton through W boson production, the Drell-Yan process, and open heavy flavor production. The muon detector system covers the rapidity range -2.2 {\textless} y {\textless} -1.2 for the south arm and 1.2 {\textless} y {\textless} 2.4 for the north arm, with full azimuthal coverage. The detector provides muon tracking and identification in the momentum range 2 {\textless} p {\textless} 50 GeV, and $\pi$/$\mu$ rejection of 10 −4 . The south muon arm was completed in 2001 for the second RHIC running period. The performance of the muon spectrometer during its first data taking period will be discussed. The production cross section for J/$\psi$ in proton-proton collisons at √ s = 200 GeV is measured. The measured value is in good agreement with the color evaporation model and QCD predictions. Although the number of J/$\psi$ currently available for study will not allow a definitive measurement of the J/$\psi$ polarization, a technique for performing the measurement is studied and a very low statistics analysis produces a result which is consistent with expectations.},

This result is derived in the Skyrme model, which is also used to estimate quark contribution to the proton spin when chiral symmetry and SU(3) are broken: this contribution turns out to be small. Therefore, even in the real world most of the proton spin is due to gluons and/or orbital angular momentum, as suggested by the EMC. We mention other experiments to test this suggestion. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {We calculate the distribution of secondary particles C in processes A +B.-0C+ anything at very high energies when (1) particle C has transverse momentum /27. far in excess of 1 GeV/c, (2) the basic reaction mechanism is presumed to be a deep-inelastic electromag-netic process, and (3) particles A, B, and C are either leptons (/ ), photons (y), or hadrons (h). We find that such distribution functions possess a scaling behavior, as governed by dimensional analysis. Furthermore, the typical behavior even for A, B, and C all hadrons, is a power-law decrease in yield with increasing pT, implying measurable yields at NAL of hadrons, leptons, and photons produced in 400- GeV pp collisions even when the observed secondary-particle pl. exceeds 8 GeV/c. There are similar implications for particle yields from e±-e- colliding-beam experiments and for hadron yields in deep-inelastic electro-production (or neutrino processes). Among the processes discussed in some detail are // —h, yy yh—h, yh-frl, as well as hh--• 1 , hh-►W, and W--h, where W is the conjectured weak-interaction intermediate boson. The basis of the calculation is an extension of the parton model. The new ingredient necessary to calculate the processes of interest is the inclusive probability for finding a hadron emerging from a parton struck in a deep-inelastic collision. This probability is taken to have a form similar to that gen-erally presumed for finding a parton in an energetic hadron. We study the dependence of our conclusions on the validity of the parton model, and conclude that they follow mainly from kinematics, duality arguments a la Bloom and Gilman, and the crucial assumption that multiplicities in such reactions grow slowly with energy. The picture we obtain generalizes the concept of deep-inelastic process, and predicts the existence of "multiple cores" in such reactions. We speculate on the possibility of strong, nonelectromagnetic deep-inelastic processes. If such processes exist, our predictions of particle yields for hh—h could be up to 4 orders of magnitude too low, and for yh---►11 and hh—y up to 2 orders of magnitude too low.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s the spin puzzle has been at the heart of many experi- mental measurements. The initial discovery that only ∼30{\%} of the spin of the proton comes from quarks and anti-quarks has been refined and cross checked by several other deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi inclusive DIS (SIDIS) experiments. Through measurements of polarized parton distri- bution functions (PDFs) the individual contributions of the u, d, u ̄, d, ̄ quarks have been measured. The flavor separation done in SIDIS experiments re- quires knowledge of fragmentation functions (FFs). However, due to the higher uncertainty of the anti-quark FFs compared to the quark FFs, the quark polarized PDFs (∆u(x), ∆d(x)) are significantly better constrained than the anti-quark distributions (∆ ̄ u(x), ∆d(x)). ̄ By accessing the anti- quarks directly through W boson production in polarized proton-proton col- lisions (ud ̄ → W + → e+/$\mu$+ and d ̄ u → W − → e− /$\mu$− ), the large FF un- certainties are avoided and a cleaner measurement can be done. The parity violating single spin asymmetry of the W decay leptons can be directly related to the polarized PDFs of the anti-quarks. The W + → e+ measurement √ has been performed with the PHENIX central arm detectors at s = 510 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and is presented in this thesis. Approximately 40 pb−1 of data from the 2011 and 2012 was analyzed and a large parity violating single spin asymmetry for W± has been measured. The combined data for 2011 and 2012 provide a single spin asymmetry for both charges: • W+: −0.27 ± 0.10(stat) ± 0.01(syst) • W−: 0.28 ± 0.16(stat) ± 0.02(syst) These results are consistent with the different theoretical predictions at the 1$\sigma$ level. The increased statistical precision enabled and required a more care- ful analysis of the background contamination for the this measurement. A method based on Gaussian Processes for Regression has been employed to determine this background contribution. This thesis contains a detailed de- scription of the analysis together with the asymmetry results and future prospects.},

We prove that the method can be applied in the general case of arbitrary beam directions and a separation scan plane. A simple method to develop an image of the beam in its transverse plane from spatial distributions of interaction vertexes is also proposed. From the beam images one can determine their overlap and the absolute luminosity. This provides an alternative way of the luminosity measurement during van der Meer scan. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

abstract = {A new silicon detector has been developed to provide the PHENIX experiment with precise charged particle tracking at forward and backward rapidity. The Forward Silicon Vertex Tracker (FVTX) was installed in PHENIX prior to the 2012 run period of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The FVTX is composed of two annular endcaps, each with four stations of silicon mini-strip sensors, covering a rapidity range of 1.2{\textless}|??|{\textless}2.2 that closely matches the two existing PHENIX muon arms. Each station consists of 48 individual silicon sensors, each of which contains two columns of mini-strips with 75 ??m pitch in the radial direction and lengths in the ? direction varying from 3.4 mm at the inner radius to 11.5 mm at the outer radius. The FVTX has approximately 0.54 million strips in each endcap. These are read out with FPHX chips, developed in collaboration with Fermilab, which are wire bonded directly to the mini-strips. The maximum strip occupancy reached in central Au-Au collisions is approximately 2.8{\%}. The precision tracking provided by this device makes the identification of muons from secondary vertices away from the primary event vertex possible. The expected distance of closest approach (DCA) resolution of 200 ??m or better for particles with a transverse momentum of 5 GeV/c will allow identification of muons from relatively long-lived particles, such as D and B mesons, through their broader DCA distributions.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

We examine how the various data sets help to constrain different aspects of the quark, anti-quark, and gluon helicity distributions. Uncertainty estimates are performed using both the Lagrange multiplier and the Hessian approaches.

abstract = {The {\$}p{\_}{\{}\backslashrm T{\}}{\$}-differential production cross sections of the prompt charmed mesons {\$}D{\^{}}0{\$}, {\$}D{\^{}}+{\$}, {\$}D{\^{}}{\{}*+{\}}{\$} and {\$}D{\_}{\{}\backslashrm s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}{\$} and their charge conjugate in the rapidity interval {\$}-0.96 {\textless} y{\_}{\{}\backslashrm cms{\}} {\textless} 0.04{\$} were measured in p-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}s{\_}{\{}\backslashrm NN{\}}{\}} = 5.02{\$} TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The nuclear modification factor {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm pPb{\}}{\$}, quantifying the D-meson yield in p-Pb collisions relative to the yield in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, is compatible within the 15-20{\%} uncertainties with unity in the transverse momentum interval {\$}1 {\textless} p{\_}{\{}\backslashrm T{\}} {\textless} 24{\$} GeV/{\$}c{\$}. No significant difference among the {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm pPb{\}}{\$} of the four D-meson species is observed. The results are described within uncertainties by theoretical calculations that include initial-state effects. The measurement adds experimental evidence that the modification of the momentum spectrum of D mesons observed in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions is due to strong final-state effects induced by hot partonic matter.},

abstract = {This analysis note describes the studies performed to confirm the information currently contained in the spin database for the 2013 running period. The additional information was taken from the local polarimeter analysis, the most recent RHIC polarimetry information, the rhicscaler database, PHENIX and CAD elogs as well as independent crossing shift studies using muon candidates. A run list for runs which passed out QA procedure is included in this note and can be used for spin analysis. However, as the spin database information might change, especially with updated final numbers from the polarimeter group it should not be viewed as a guarantee to trust all the information in the spin database blindly.. We generally recommend every spin analyzer to at least confirm the correct crossing shift when using the spin database. At present 1008 runs of Run13 are available on the Analysis Taxi. Currently 48 of these runs do not contain spin information in the database due to lacking polarimetry information at this stage. Furthermore 4 runs are flagged by suspicious crossing shift information and about 38 runs have some concerns with the scalers but are otherwise useable. The previous runs that were havng incorrectly assigned spin patterns are fixed now.},

A wide variety of probes, sensitive to all timescales, are used to study systematic variations with species and energy as well as to measure the spin structure of the nucleon. Designing for the needs of the heavy-ion and polarized-proton programs has produced a detector with unparalleled capabilities. PHENIX measures electron and muon pairs, photons, and hadrons with excellent energy and momentum resolution. The detector consists of a large number of subsystems that are discussed in other papers in this volume.

abstract = {A model for highly inelastic electron-nucleon scattering at high energies is studied and compared with existing data. This model envisages the proton to be composed of pointlike constituents ("partons") from which the electron scatters incoherently. We propose that the model be tested by observing y rays scattered inelastically in a similar way from the nucleon. The magnitude of this inelastic Compton-scattering cross section can be predicted from existing electron-scattering data, indicating that the experiment is feasible, but dificult, at presently available energies.},

abstract = {Ever since Luria's essay on ancient atomism1 began to be read with more than passing interest, a major issue in Democritean studies has been the question whether or not Democritus' atom was intended to be mathematically divisible. The array of com- petent scholars ranging themselves on either side of the question is impressive.2 Those who hold that it was mathematically indivisible are led to this opinion primarily by the mathematical nature of Zeno's arguments and by Aristotle's reformulation of those arguments in explaining the foundations of Democritus' atomic theory. This essay attempts to defend the claim that Democritus' atom was as mathematically divisible, to integrate Democritus' view of divisibility into the distinction he made between statements about perceived objects and those about atoms and void, and, thus, to suggest a new light in which one may view the nature of Democritus' response to Zeno's arguments},

@article{Brodsky2013,
abstract = {We examine in detail the diagrammatic mechanisms which provide the change of sign between the single transverse spin asymmetries measured in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and in the Drell-Yan process (DY). This asymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target proton combined with a T-odd complex phase. Using the discrete symmetry properties of transverse spinors, we show that the required complex phase originates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective cuts. For simplicity, we work in a model where the proton consists of a valence quark and a scalar diquark. We then show that the phases generated in SIDIS and in DY originate from distinctly different cuts in the amplitudes, which at first appears to obscure the relationship between the single-spin asymmetries in the two processes. Nevertheless, further analysis demonstrates that the contributions of these cuts are identical in the leading-twist Bjorken kinematics considered, resulting in the standard sign-flip relation between the Sivers functions in SIDIS and DY. Physically, this fundamental, but yet untested, prediction occurs because the Sivers effect in the Drell-Yan reaction is modified by the initial-state "lensing" interactions of the annihilating antiquark, in contrast to the final-state lensing which produces the Sivers effect in deep inelastic scattering.},

The determination is based on the NNPDF methodology: a Monte Carlo approach, with neural networks used as unbiased interpolants, previously applied to the determination of unpolarized parton distributions, and designed to provide a faithful and statistically sound representation of PDF uncertainties. We present our dataset, its statistical features, and its Monte Carlo representation. We summarize the technique used to solve the polarized evolution equations and its benchmarking, and the method used to compute physical observables. We review the NNPDF methodology for parametrization and fitting of neural networks, the algorithm used to determine the optimal fit, and its adaptation to the polarized case. We finally present our set of polarized parton distributions. We discuss its statistical properties, test for its stability upon various modifications of the fitting procedure, and compare it to other recent polarized parton sets, and in particular obtain predictions for polarized first moments of PDFs based on it. We find that the uncertainties on the gluon, and to a lesser extent the strange PDF, were substantially underestimated in previous determinations.},

The collision rate, as measured by the ZDC, corresponds to the rate of mutual forward neutral particles above a variable threshold and within a certain coincidence window. Due to the differences in the detector electronics the two devices are calibrated individually every year by the use of vernier scans [2]. During the RHIC polarized proton Run in 2013 a total of 6 vernier scans per experiment were performed.

The additional muon trigger detectors and Level-1 trigger electronics will allow the experiment to select high momentum muons from the decay of W-bosons and reject both beam-associated and low-momentum collision background, enabling the study of quark and antiquark polarization in the proton. The muon trigger upgrade will add momentum and timing information to the present muon Level-1 trigger, which only makes use of tracking in the PHENIX muon identifier (MuID) panels. Signals from three new resistive plate chambers (RPC's) and re-instrumented planes in the existing muon tracking (MuTr) chambers will provide momentum and timing information for the new Level-1 trigger. An RPC timing resolution of {\~{}}2ns will permit rejection of beam related backgrounds.},

abstract = {Asymptotically free gauge theories of the strong interactions are constructed and analyzed. The reasons for doing this are recounted, including a review of renormalization-group techniques and their application to scaling phenomena. The renormalization-group equations are derived for Yang-Mills theories. The parameters that enter into the equations are calculated to lowest order and it is shown that these theories are asymptotically free. More specifically the effective coupling constant, which determines the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, vanishes for large spacelike momenta. Fermions are incorporated and the construction of realistic models is discussed. We propose that the strong interactions be mediated by a "color" gauge group which commutes with SU(3) × SU(3). The problem of symmetry breaking is discussed. It appears likely that this would have a dynamical origin. It is suggested that the gauge symmetry might not be broken and that the severe infrared singularities prevent the occurrence of noncolor singlet physical states. The deep-inelastic structure functions, as well as the electron-positron total annihilation cross section are analyzed. Scaling obtains up to calculable logarithmic corrections, and the naive light-cone or parton-model results follow. The problems of incorporating scalar mesons and breaking the symmetry by the Higgs mechanism are explained in detail.},

Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks – up, down, and strange – to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge.[19][20][21] The initial reaction of the physics community to the proposal was mixed. There was particular contention about whether the quark was a physical entity or an abstraction used to explain concepts that were not properly understood at the time.},

abstract = {Results of electron-proton inelastic scattering at 6' and 10' are discussed, and values of the structure function {\~{}}2 are estimated. If the interaction is dominated by transverse virtual photons, vW2 can be expressed as a function of v = 2M v/q within experimental errors for q2 {\&} 1 (GeV/c)2 and {\&}u {\&}4, where v is the invariant energy transfer and q2 is the invariant momentum transfer of the electron. Various theoretical models and sum rules are briefly discussed. In a previous Letter, ' we have reported experi-mental results from a Stanford Linear Accelera-tor Center-Massachusetts Institute of Technol-ogy study of high-energy inelastic electron-pro-ton scattering. Measurements of inelastic spec-tra, in which only the scattered electrons were detected, were made at scattering angles of 6' and 10' and with incident energies between 7 and 17 GeV. In this communication, we discuss some of the salient features of inelastic spectra in the deep continuum region. One of the interesting features of the measure-ments is the weak momentum-transfer depen-dence of the inelastic cross sections for excita-tions well beyond the resonance region. This weak dependence is illustrated in Fig. 1. Here we have plotted the differential cross section di-vided by the Mott cross section, (d'a/dQdE')/ (do d/Q) M«, as a function of the square of the four-momentum transfer, q'= 2EE'(1-cos0), for constant values of the invariant mass of the re-coiling target system, W, where W'= 2M(E E')-+M' -q'. E is the energy of the incident electron, E' is the energy of the final electron, and 0 is the scattering angle, all defined in the labora-tory system; M is the mass of the proton. The cross section is divided by the Mott cross sec-tion (dG e' cos'p(9 d Mott 4E Sin 2 in order to remove the major part of the well-known four -momentum transfer dependence aris-ing from the photon propagator.

The relatively slow variation with q2 of the inelastic cross section compared with the elastic cross section is clearly shown. between the behavior of the inelastic and elastic cross sections is also illustrated in Fig. 1, where the elastic cross section, divided by the Mott cross section for L9 = 10', is included.

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

abstract = {Consequences of the local commutation relations of vector and axial currents proposed by Gell-Mann are explored: (1) A recipe for detecting and isolating Schwinger terms in the commutators, proportional to derivatives of the Il function, is discussed. (2) Under assumptions of smooth asymptotic behavior of form factors for forward scattering of the isovector current from a proton, we show that the U(3)(8)U(3) algebra for the time components of the currents implies the U(6)(8)U(6) algebra for space components, at least for spin-averaged diagonal single-particle states. (3) The derivation of the Adler-Weisberger formula for GA/GV is sharpened by giving arguments that, at fixed energy, the forward ?r-p Green's function satisfies an un- subtracted dispersion relation in the pion mass. (4) A lower bound for inelastic electron-nucleon scattering at high momentum transfer is derived on the basis of U(6)(8)U(6). (5) The contribution of very virtual photons to the hyperfine anomaly in hydrogen is shown to be related to an equal-time commutator of cur- rents; this contribution is crudely estimated to be {\textless}4 parts per million (ppm). (6) The logarithmically divergent part of electromagnetic mass differences of hadrons is shown to be proportional to matrix elements of the equal-time commutator of the electromagnetic current with its time derivative. It is suggested that this "divergent" part be identified with the Coleman-Glashow "tadpoles"; this suggestion is discussed in the framework of a simple quark model. (7) The logarithmically divergent part of the electromagnetic correction to the process?r- -{\textgreater} .,rJ+e-+ii is, on the basis of the U(6)(8)U(6) current algebra, shown to be nonvanishing, and is computed. (8) A speculative argument is presented that the rate e++e- -{\textgreater} hadrons is comparable to the rate e+ +e--{\textgreater} p,+ +p,- in the limit of large energies.},

abstract = {The spin asymmetry in deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarised muons by longitudinally polarised protons has been measured in the range 0.01{\textless}×{\textless}0.7. The spin dependent structure function g1(x) for the proton has been determined and, combining the data with earlier SLAC measurements, its integral over x found to be 0.126±0.010(stat.)±0.015(syst.), in disagreement with the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule. Assuming the validity of the Biorken sum rule, this result implies a significant negative value for the integral of g1 for the neutron. These integrals lead to the conclusion, in the na{\"{i}}ve quark parton model, that the total quark spin constitutes a rather small fraction of the spin of the nucleon. Results are also presented on the asymmetries in inclusive hadron production which are consistent with the above picture. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Measuring the flavor-separated quarks polarization is one of the primary goals in the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in order to understand the proton spin structure. The sea quark parton distri- ubution fuction (PDF) is not well known while the valence quark PDF is well constrained. The asymmetry of W boson production AL from polarized proton is sensitive to the helicity distri- bution of quarks and anti-quarks, so that the asymmetry measurement enables to access the sea quark contribution to the proton spin. RHIC provides us unique opportunity to perform this mea- surement using the longitudinally polarized proton collisions at center of mass energy up to√s = 510 GeV. PHENIX has measuredWboson through their leptonic decays into electrons at central rapidity (|$\eta$|{\textless}0.35) and muons at forward/backward rapidities (1.2{\textless}|$\eta$|{\textless}2.2). In succession to the first measurement performed in 2011, PHENIX collected twice of the data with integrated luminosity of 50 pb−1 in 2012 with fully upgraded detectors and triggering system. We will present recent results of W to electron and muon decay channels and the prospect of the further analysis.},

abstract = {The high-energy process {\$}p+p\backslashrightarrow \backslashmu{\^{}}+ + \backslashmu{\^{}}- + X{\$} for dimuons with large invariant mass is studied in the case that the protons are polarized. In general, the cross section {\$}d\backslashsigma/\backslashdQ{\^{}}2 dt d\backslashOmega{\$} is determined by nine structure functions, and several interesting correlations between the polarization direction and the observed cross section are possible. In the Drell-Yan parton model for the process, the structure of the cross section is much simpler: there are six linear relations among the structure functions. An experimental test of these relations would provide a stringent test of the Drell-Yan model.},

We have known since the 'proton-spin crisis' $\backslash$cite{\{}Ashman1988{\}} of the late 1980s that proton spin does not entirely reside in the valence quarks, so the thrust of experimental efforts since then have been designed to determine both how to probe the proton spin structure, and how to validate models for proton spin structure. Here, I discuss one particular approach to understanding the sea-quark spin contribution, which utilizes the production of real {\$}W{\$}-bosons, and the {\$}W{\$} coupling with polarized spin structure in the proton sea, as produced from polarized proton-proton collisions. Only one of the colliding protons is longitudinally spin polarized, in this analysis, and they are collided at an energy of {\$}500 GeV{\$}. The experimental observable used is referred to as "{\$}A{\_}L{\$}" which is expressed mathematically as a ratio of sums and differences of various helicity combinations of singly polarized interactions between two protons, i.e. {\$}p+p{\^{}}{\{}\backslashRightarrow{\}}: \backslashrightarrow W \backslashrightarrow \backslashmu + \backslashnu{\$}. Once {\$}A{\_}L{\$} has been experimentally measured, it can then be used to determine appropriate polarizations of proton sea-quarks, within a given uncertainty, if we write the cross-sections used in the calculation of {\$}A{\_}L{\$} in terms of polarized parton distribution functions. Finally, this thesis will also include a discussion of my work experimentally determining the absolute luminosity of collisions at RHIC, which is needed as a normalization on any cross section used in the analysis. In particular, studying the cross section of the {\$}W{\$} interaction can help to validate our models for assigning a signal-to-background ratio to the {\$}W\backslashrightarrow\backslashmu{\$} events. $\backslash$end{\{}abstract{\}}},

abstract = {In PHENIX experiment, one of the most important goals is to study proton spin structure through spin asymmetry measurements of various production cross sections from polarized proton-proton collisions. In 2013, we had longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions. The gluon contribution to the proton ∆G measurement through longitudinal double spin asymmetry ALL measurement has been done. Since one of the main systematic uncertainty of ALL comes from transverse component of beam polarization, its measurement is very important. In order to measure transverse component of beam polarization at the collision point in the PHENIX interaction area, a subsystem called local polarimeter is used by using AN of forward neutron production. It turned out that, transverse component of longitudinally polarized beam during the experiment does not significantly contribute systematic error in ALL measurement.},

abstract = {One of the central dogmas of modern science is that the world around us can be understood in terms of microscopic chemical entities known as atoms. It may come as a surprise that this notion has only been widely acknowledged since the 1910s. The French physicist Jean Perrin had a hand in many of the key developments that led to the emergence of the atomic doctrine. His life story relates how new technologies were used to 'see' these invisible particles of philosophy and how scientists were able to determine their size and composition. The indivisible atoms of the ancients were replaced by the highly structured elements of chemistry. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents an effective jump-diffusion method for segmenting a range image and its associated reflectance image in the Bayesian framework. The algorithm works on complex real-world scenes (indoor and outdoor), which consist of an unknown number of objects (or surfaces) of various sizes and types, such as planes, conics, smooth surfaces, and cluttered objects (like trees and bushes). Formulated in the Bayesian framework, the posterior probability is distributed over a solution space with a countable number of subspaces of varying dimensions. The algorithm simulates Markov chains with both reversible jumps and stochastic diffusions to traverse the solution space. The reversible jumps realize the moves between subspaces of different dimensions, such as switching surface models and changing the number of objects. The stochastic Langevin equation realizes diffusions within each subspace. To achieve effective computation, the algorithm precomputes some importance proposal probabilities over multiple scales through Hough transforms, edge detection, and data clustering. The latter are used by the Markov chains for fast mixing. The algorithm is tested on 100 1D simulated data sets for performance analysis on both accuracy and speed. Then, the algorithm is applied to three data sets of range images under the same parameter setting. The results are satisfactory in comparison with manual segmentations.},
