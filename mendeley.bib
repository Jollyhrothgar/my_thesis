abstract = {The spin asymmetry in deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarised muons by longitudinally polarised protons has been measured in the range 0.01{\textless}×{\textless}0.7. The spin dependent structure function g1(x) for the proton has been determined and, combining the data with earlier SLAC measurements, its integral over x found to be 0.126±0.010(stat.)±0.015(syst.), in disagreement with the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule. Assuming the validity of the Biorken sum rule, this result implies a significant negative value for the integral of g1 for the neutron. These integrals lead to the conclusion, in the na{\"{i}}ve quark parton model, that the total quark spin constitutes a rather small fraction of the spin of the nucleon. Results are also presented on the asymmetries in inclusive hadron production which are consistent with the above picture. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

For the determination of A1 ,in addition to the usual method which employs inclusive scattering events and includes a large radiative back- ground at low x, we use a new method which minimizes the radiative background by selecting events with at least one hadron as well as a muon in the final state. We find that this hadron method gives smaller errors for x?0.02, so it is combined with the usual method to provide the optimal set of results. ?S0556-2821?98?07017-9? PACS},

It was commissioned by the managements of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) with the objective of presenting a summary of scientific opportunities and goals of the EIC as a follow-up to the 2007 NSAC Long Range plan. This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on "Gluons and quark sea at high energies" at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required to achieve them, and it benefited from inputs from the users' communities of BNL and JLab. This White Paper offers the promise to propel the QCD science program in the U.S., established with the CEBAF accelerator at JLab and the RHIC collider at BNL, to the next QCD frontier.},

abstract = {A new model of the higher symmetry of elementary particles is introduced ln which the eight known baryons are treated as a supermultiplet, degenerate in the limit of unitary symmetry but split into isotopic spin multiplets by a symmetry-breaking term. The symmetry violation is ascribed phenomenologically to the mass differences. The baryons correspond to an eight-dimensional irreducible representation of the unitary group. The pion and K meson fit into a similar set of eight particles along with a predicted pseudoscalar meson X {\{}sup o{\}} having I = 0. A ninth vector meson coupled to the baryon current can be accommodated naturally in the scheme. It is predicted that the eight baryons should all have the same spin and parity and that pseudoscalar and vector mesons should form octets with possible additional singlets. The mathematics of the unitary group is described by considering three fictitious leptons, nu , e {\{}sup -{\}}, and mu {\{}sup -{\}}, which may throw light on the structure of weak interactions. (D.

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

abstract = {At the end of RHIC's 2009 operation a dedicated run for the PP2PP experiment (part of the STAR experiment) took place from Jun 29 to Jul 06 2009. Polarized protons were accelerated to 100 GeV using ramp-file pp100-90pp2pp with a $\beta$∗ = 22min IR6. Since only transverse polarization was required no rotator ramp was in use. The PP2PP experiment consists mainly of two Roman Pot detectors (one horizontal and one vertical) on either side of IR6 in the outgoing-beam arms between the Q3 and Q4 magnets. The yellow pots are in sector 5, the blue ones in sector 6. Roman Pot type detectors are installed inside the beampipe causing an accelerator safety concern. To address this concern there is a limit to the allowable total beam current in the machine while Roman Pots are enabled to move closer to the beam. This limit was set to a motion limit of 5 mm from the center of the beampipe and 50 {\textperiodcentered}1011 beam current per ring [1]. In order to reduce the background in the detectors, beams were scraped using the RHIC collimator system prior to moving the pots closer. This was typically repeated several times throughout a store since beam halo reforms over the course of hours. 2},

The collision rate, as measured by the ZDC, corresponds to the rate of mutual forward neutral particles above a variable threshold and within a certain coincidence window. Due to the differences in the detector electronics the two devices are calibrated individually every year by the use of vernier scans [2]. During the RHIC polarized proton Run in 2013 a total of 6 vernier scans per experiment were performed.

abstract = {Results of electron-proton inelastic scattering at 6' and 10' are discussed, and values of the structure function {\~{}}2 are estimated. If the interaction is dominated by transverse virtual photons, vW2 can be expressed as a function of v = 2M v/q within experimental errors for q2 {\&} 1 (GeV/c)2 and {\&}u {\&}4, where v is the invariant energy transfer and q2 is the invariant momentum transfer of the electron. Various theoretical models and sum rules are briefly discussed. In a previous Letter, ' we have reported experi-mental results from a Stanford Linear Accelera-tor Center-Massachusetts Institute of Technol-ogy study of high-energy inelastic electron-pro-ton scattering. Measurements of inelastic spec-tra, in which only the scattered electrons were detected, were made at scattering angles of 6' and 10' and with incident energies between 7 and 17 GeV. In this communication, we discuss some of the salient features of inelastic spectra in the deep continuum region. One of the interesting features of the measure-ments is the weak momentum-transfer depen-dence of the inelastic cross sections for excita-tions well beyond the resonance region. This weak dependence is illustrated in Fig. 1. Here we have plotted the differential cross section di-vided by the Mott cross section, (d'a/dQdE')/ (do d/Q) M«, as a function of the square of the four-momentum transfer, q'= 2EE'(1-cos0), for constant values of the invariant mass of the re-coiling target system, W, where W'= 2M(E E')-+M' -q'. E is the energy of the incident electron, E' is the energy of the final electron, and 0 is the scattering angle, all defined in the labora-tory system; M is the mass of the proton.

We summarize the technique used to solve the polarized evolution equations and its benchmarking, and the method used to compute physical observables. We review the NNPDF methodology for parametrization and fitting of neural networks, the algorithm used to determine the optimal fit, and its adaptation to the polarized case. We finally present our set of polarized parton distributions. We discuss its statistical properties, test for its stability upon various modifications of the fitting procedure, and compare it to other recent polarized parton sets, and in particular obtain predictions for polarized first moments of PDFs based on it. We find that the uncertainties on the gluon, and to a lesser extent the strange PDF, were substantially underestimated in previous determinations.},

Longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic scattering data, already used for the previous NNPDFpol1.0 PDF set, are supplemented with the most recent polarized hadron collider data for inclusive jet and W boson production from the STAR and PHENIX experiments at RHIC, and with open-charm production data from the COMPASS experiment, thereby allowing for a separate determination of the polarized quark and antiquark PDFs, and an improved determination of the medium- and large-. x polarized gluon PDF. We study the phenomenological implications of the NNPDFpol1.1 set, and we provide predictions for the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for semi-inclusive pion production at RHIC.},

It may come as a surprise that this notion has only been widely acknowledged since the 1910s. The French physicist Jean Perrin had a hand in many of the key developments that led to the emergence of the atomic doctrine. His life story relates how new technologies were used to 'see' these invisible particles of philosophy and how scientists were able to determine their size and composition. The indivisible atoms of the ancients were replaced by the highly structured elements of chemistry. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

We examine how the various data sets help to constrain different aspects of the quark, anti-quark, and gluon helicity distributions. Uncertainty estimates are performed using both the Lagrange multiplier and the Hessian approaches.

We first give an optimal $\Theta$ ( n log n ) algorithm for the general case. In the special case where the points in P are given in sorted order according to their x -coordinates, we give an optimal $\Theta$ ( n ) time algorithm. Then, we show how to solve the weighted version of this problem in time O ( n log 4 n ). Finally, we give an O ( n h 2 log h ) algorithm for the case where h outliers are allowed, and the input is sorted. The running time of all our algorithms is independent of k .},

abstract = {The absolute luminosity can be measured in an accelerator by sweeping beams transversely across each other in the so-called van der Meer scan. We prove that the method can be applied in the general case of arbitrary beam directions and a separation scan plane. A simple method to develop an image of the beam in its transverse plane from spatial distributions of interaction vertexes is also proposed. From the beam images one can determine their overlap and the absolute luminosity. This provides an alternative way of the luminosity measurement during van der Meer scan. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Han2004,
abstract = {This paper presents an effective jump-diffusion method for segmenting a range image and its associated reflectance image in the Bayesian framework. The algorithm works on complex real-world scenes (indoor and outdoor), which consist of an unknown number of objects (or surfaces) of various sizes and types, such as planes, conics, smooth surfaces, and cluttered objects (like trees and bushes). Formulated in the Bayesian framework, the posterior probability is distributed over a solution space with a countable number of subspaces of varying dimensions. The algorithm simulates Markov chains with both reversible jumps and stochastic diffusions to traverse the solution space. The reversible jumps realize the moves between subspaces of different dimensions, such as switching surface models and changing the number of objects. The stochastic Langevin equation realizes diffusions within each subspace. To achieve effective computation, the algorithm precomputes some importance proposal probabilities over multiple scales through Hough transforms, edge detection, and data clustering. The latter are used by the Markov chains for fast mixing. The algorithm is tested on 100 1D simulated data sets for performance analysis on both accuracy and speed. Then, the algorithm is applied to three data sets of range images under the same parameter setting. The results are satisfactory in comparison with manual segmentations.},

abstract = {We examine in detail the diagrammatic mechanisms which provide the change of sign between the single transverse spin asymmetries measured in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and in the Drell-Yan process (DY). This asymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target proton combined with a T-odd complex phase. Using the discrete symmetry properties of transverse spinors, we show that the required complex phase originates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective cuts. For simplicity, we work in a model where the proton consists of a valence quark and a scalar diquark. We then show that the phases generated in SIDIS and in DY originate from distinctly different cuts in the amplitudes, which at first appears to obscure the relationship between the single-spin asymmetries in the two processes. Nevertheless, further analysis demonstrates that the contributions of these cuts are identical in the leading-twist Bjorken kinematics considered, resulting in the standard sign-flip relation between the Sivers functions in SIDIS and DY. Physically, this fundamental, but yet untested, prediction occurs because the Sivers effect in the Drell-Yan reaction is modified by the initial-state "lensing" interactions of the annihilating antiquark, in contrast to the final-state lensing which produces the Sivers effect in deep inelastic scattering.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},
