abstract = {Results of electron-proton inelastic scattering at 6' and 10' are discussed, and values of the structure function {\~{}}2 are estimated. If the interaction is dominated by transverse virtual photons, vW2 can be expressed as a function of v = 2M v/q within experimental errors for q2 {\&} 1 (GeV/c)2 and {\&}u {\&}4, where v is the invariant energy transfer and q2 is the invariant momentum transfer of the electron. Various theoretical models and sum rules are briefly discussed. In a previous Letter, ' we have reported experi-mental results from a Stanford Linear Accelera-tor Center-Massachusetts Institute of Technol-ogy study of high-energy inelastic electron-pro-ton scattering. Measurements of inelastic spec-tra, in which only the scattered electrons were detected, were made at scattering angles of 6' and 10' and with incident energies between 7 and 17 GeV. In this communication, we discuss some of the salient features of inelastic spectra in the deep continuum region. One of the interesting features of the measure-ments is the weak momentum-transfer depen-dence of the inelastic cross sections for excita-tions well beyond the resonance region. This weak dependence is illustrated in Fig. 1. Here we have plotted the differential cross section di-vided by the Mott cross section, (d'a/dQdE')/ (do d/Q) M«, as a function of the square of the four-momentum transfer, q'= 2EE'(1-cos0), for constant values of the invariant mass of the re-coiling target system, W, where W'= 2M(E E')-+M' -q'. E is the energy of the incident electron, E' is the energy of the final electron, and 0 is the scattering angle, all defined in the labora-tory system; M is the mass of the proton. The cross section is divided by the Mott cross sec-tion (dG e' cos'p(9 d Mott 4E Sin 2 in order to remove the major part of the well-known four -momentum transfer dependence aris-ing from the photon propagator.

abstract = {At RHIC the collision rate per IP is measured by the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) [1]. Both, STAR and PHENIX, contain those detectors that are of identical design but are equipped with different Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMT) and operated with individually different HV setups and also slightly different read-out electronics. The collision rate, as measured by the ZDC, corresponds to the rate of mutual forward neutral particles above a variable threshold and within a certain coincidence window. Due to the differences in the detector electronics the two devices are calibrated individually every year by the use of vernier scans [2]. During the RHIC polarized proton Run in 2013 a total of 6 vernier scans per experiment were performed. This note presents the data and summarizes the results, i.e. effective ZDC cross section and emittance measurements, from those scans.},

abstract = {At the end of RHIC's 2009 operation a dedicated run for the PP2PP experiment (part of the STAR experiment) took place from Jun 29 to Jul 06 2009. Polarized protons were accelerated to 100 GeV using ramp-file pp100-90pp2pp with a $\beta$∗ = 22min IR6. Since only transverse polarization was required no rotator ramp was in use. The PP2PP experiment consists mainly of two Roman Pot detectors (one horizontal and one vertical) on either side of IR6 in the outgoing-beam arms between the Q3 and Q4 magnets. The yellow pots are in sector 5, the blue ones in sector 6. Roman Pot type detectors are installed inside the beampipe causing an accelerator safety concern. To address this concern there is a limit to the allowable total beam current in the machine while Roman Pots are enabled to move closer to the beam. This limit was set to a motion limit of 5 mm from the center of the beampipe and 50 {\textperiodcentered}1011 beam current per ring [1]. In order to reduce the background in the detectors, beams were scraped using the RHIC collimator system prior to moving the pots closer. This was typically repeated several times throughout a store since beam halo reforms over the course of hours. 2},

Realizing this peculiarity the quark polarization agrees with that given by the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule, i.e. is consistent with the prediction derived from the experimentally determined weak coupling constants. It also solves the problem with the under-exhaustion of the fundamental Bjorken-sum rule.},

abstract = {A new model of the higher symmetry of elementary particles is introduced ln which the eight known baryons are treated as a supermultiplet, degenerate in the limit of unitary symmetry but split into isotopic spin multiplets by a symmetry-breaking term. The symmetry violation is ascribed phenomenologically to the mass differences. The baryons correspond to an eight-dimensional irreducible representation of the unitary group. The pion and K meson fit into a similar set of eight particles along with a predicted pseudoscalar meson X {\{}sup o{\}} having I = 0. A ninth vector meson coupled to the baryon current can be accommodated naturally in the scheme. It is predicted that the eight baryons should all have the same spin and parity and that pseudoscalar and vector mesons should form octets with possible additional singlets. The mathematics of the unitary group is described by considering three fictitious leptons, nu , e {\{}sup -{\}}, and mu {\{}sup -{\}}, which may throw light on the structure of weak interactions. (D.
