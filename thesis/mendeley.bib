abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on "Gluons and quark sea at high energies" at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required to achieve them, and it benefited from inputs from the users' communities of BNL and JLab. This White Paper offers the promise to propel the QCD science program in the U.S., established with the CEBAF accelerator at JLab and the RHIC collider at BNL, to the next QCD frontier.},

abstract = {A new model of the higher symmetry of elementary particles is introduced ln which the eight known baryons are treated as a supermultiplet, degenerate in the limit of unitary symmetry but split into isotopic spin multiplets by a symmetry-breaking term. The symmetry violation is ascribed phenomenologically to the mass differences. The baryons correspond to an eight-dimensional irreducible representation of the unitary group. The pion and K meson fit into a similar set of eight particles along with a predicted pseudoscalar meson X {\{}sup o{\}} having I = 0. A ninth vector meson coupled to the baryon current can be accommodated naturally in the scheme. It is predicted that the eight baryons should all have the same spin and parity and that pseudoscalar and vector mesons should form octets with possible additional singlets. The mathematics of the unitary group is described by considering three fictitious leptons, nu , e {\{}sup -{\}}, and mu {\{}sup -{\}}, which may throw light on the structure of weak interactions. (D.

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

abstract = {The small fraction of the quark polarization of the nucleon obtained in deep inelastic lepton scattering is a consequence of a wrong assumption on the flux of polarized virtual photons in the analysis of the data. The true flux of polarized photons is at least 20{\%} smaller than assumed and, therefore, the quark polarization is larger. Realizing this peculiarity the quark polarization agrees with that given by the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule, i.e. is consistent with the prediction derived from the experimentally determined weak coupling constants. It also solves the problem with the under-exhaustion of the fundamental Bjorken-sum rule.},

abstract = {At the end of RHIC's 2009 operation a dedicated run for the PP2PP experiment (part of the STAR experiment) took place from Jun 29 to Jul 06 2009. Polarized protons were accelerated to 100 GeV using ramp-file pp100-90pp2pp with a $\beta$∗ = 22min IR6. Since only transverse polarization was required no rotator ramp was in use. The PP2PP experiment consists mainly of two Roman Pot detectors (one horizontal and one vertical) on either side of IR6 in the outgoing-beam arms between the Q3 and Q4 magnets. The yellow pots are in sector 5, the blue ones in sector 6. Roman Pot type detectors are installed inside the beampipe causing an accelerator safety concern. To address this concern there is a limit to the allowable total beam current in the machine while Roman Pots are enabled to move closer to the beam. This limit was set to a motion limit of 5 mm from the center of the beampipe and 50 {\textperiodcentered}1011 beam current per ring [1]. In order to reduce the background in the detectors, beams were scraped using the RHIC collimator system prior to moving the pots closer. This was typically repeated several times throughout a store since beam halo reforms over the course of hours. 2},

abstract = {At RHIC the collision rate per IP is measured by the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) [1]. Both, STAR and PHENIX, contain those detectors that are of identical design but are equipped with different Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMT) and operated with individually different HV setups and also slightly different read-out electronics. The collision rate, as measured by the ZDC, corresponds to the rate of mutual forward neutral particles above a variable threshold and within a certain coincidence window. Due to the differences in the detector electronics the two devices are calibrated individually every year by the use of vernier scans [2]. During the RHIC polarized proton Run in 2013 a total of 6 vernier scans per experiment were performed. This note presents the data and summarizes the results, i.e. effective ZDC cross section and emittance measurements, from those scans.},

abstract = {Results of electron-proton inelastic scattering at 6' and 10' are discussed, and values of the structure function {\~{}}2 are estimated. If the interaction is dominated by transverse virtual photons, vW2 can be expressed as a function of v = 2M v/q within experimental errors for q2 {\&} 1 (GeV/c)2 and {\&}u {\&}4, where v is the invariant energy transfer and q2 is the invariant momentum transfer of the electron. Various theoretical models and sum rules are briefly discussed. In a previous Letter, ' we have reported experi-mental results from a Stanford Linear Accelera-tor Center-Massachusetts Institute of Technol-ogy study of high-energy inelastic electron-pro-ton scattering. Measurements of inelastic spec-tra, in which only the scattered electrons were detected, were made at scattering angles of 6' and 10' and with incident energies between 7 and 17 GeV. In this communication, we discuss some of the salient features of inelastic spectra in the deep continuum region. One of the interesting features of the measure-ments is the weak momentum-transfer depen-dence of the inelastic cross sections for excita-tions well beyond the resonance region. This weak dependence is illustrated in Fig. 1. Here we have plotted the differential cross section di-vided by the Mott cross section, (d'a/dQdE')/ (do d/Q) M«, as a function of the square of the four-momentum transfer, q'= 2EE'(1-cos0), for constant values of the invariant mass of the re-coiling target system, W, where W'= 2M(E E')-+M' -q'. E is the energy of the incident electron, E' is the energy of the final electron, and 0 is the scattering angle, all defined in the labora-tory system; M is the mass of the proton. The cross section is divided by the Mott cross sec-tion (dG e' cos'p(9 d Mott 4E Sin 2 in order to remove the major part of the well-known four -momentum transfer dependence aris-ing from the photon propagator.

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},
