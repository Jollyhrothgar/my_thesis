I have read about half of the draft which you pointed me to a week or so ago.
Generally, it reads well.  There are lots of instances of formatting which you
will need to fix (eg. single '-' instead of '--', italics incorrect on units,
symbols...).  Aneta will try to copy what I have and email to you later.

There are a few substantial issues which I see:

(1) You give way too much credit to other people.  You should not.  In fact,
you should not name anyone in the text unless it is extremely tied to a model.
If you are so inclined, this should be mentioned in the acknowledgements.

(2) The language used in some of your descriptions is not scientific.  The
thesis is a serious business, hugging and canning is not allowed.  More than
this, there are large swathes of descriptions which are not precise and are
left hand-wavy.

(3) Your upgrades sections do not always relate to the upgrade, with mixtures
of describing the muon tracker, muid, in there which is not appropriate.  These
should be described elsewhere.  When talking about the upgrades, I would add
more details.  It's noted and some example text is written.

(4) You have too many photos.  While nice, they don't add too much.  You could
place them and their description in an appendix, leaving the physics and
mechanical description in the main text.

(5) Finally, at least for now.  There is some befuddlement of timing of
upgrades, reasons, and the cause for some decisions.  I tried to fill in some
gaps, but you should think a little more in some places where I have commented
on issues.


I stopped at Chapter 5, and skipped some of the theory as I wanted to read the
more relevant pieces.  I'll have another go over the weekend.  If you think the
amount of red ink is too much, you should have seen David and Tim's (multiple
times).
