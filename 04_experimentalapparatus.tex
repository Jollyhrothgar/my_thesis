\chapter{The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider}

\section{Overview}
While there have been many experiments which have performed deep inelastic
scattering over the years, the experiments built around the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory are positioned to take advantage
of the unique accelerator.

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is the world's only intersecting ring
particle accelerator which is capable of producing polarized proton beams. The
beams are differentiated with the mnemonic "Blue" and "Yellow" beam. The Blue
beam circulates clockwise when viewed from above the RHIC complex, the Yellow
beam circulates counter-clockwise. As is typical for intersecting ring
experiments, the beams are bunched, with bunches of ions intersecting at
designated intersection points, around which experiments are built. The Blue
beam is nominally used to time these collisions, such that experiments which
have bunch-sensitive measurements (i.e. any experiment where bunch polarization
is important) can associate the correct punch polarization with the correct
collision. This will be discussed more in the section of beam-polarization
(\ref{sec:beam_polarization}).

RHIC generally separates data taking into beam 'fills' which are uniquely
numbered, and for which general data characterizing the machine state is logged
in various databases and online logbooks. Each fill is a unique population of
beam ions, circulating around the RHIC rings. The beam ions are subdivided into
discrete collections of ions called bunches. At the end of each fill, (typically
8 hours of collisions), the beam is dumped, and a new fill is generated.
Experiments built around RHIC generally subdivide fills into 'runs', where a run
is a period of time where the experiment is taking data. At PHENIX, runs are
always segregated within a fill - no run will ever contain data from multiple
fills.

Scientists at RHIC have come up with many ingenious ways to create and maintain
beam polarization, once this is accomplished, various kinematically select
probes are engineered, based on collisions observed which provide important
cross-checks to DIS data as well as original discoveries and measurements of
proton structure. RHIC is a unique collider in that it is quite flexible. Beams
may be transversely or longitudinally polarized, a variety of ions may be used
to fill the beams. To date, RHIC has collided many beam ions and species,
summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:rhic_early_run_summary} and
Figure~\ref{fig:rhic_late_run_summary}.

RHIC is an experiment which has been built on top of previous accelerator
experiments which have been reused magnificently - a Linear Accelerator, a
booster ring, and an Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, all of which now have
been repurposeed to create a high quality collider physics experiment. Many
experiments are still set up around various egress points along the acceleration
chain, which are publicised on the Brookhaven National Laboratory website

At the time of writing of this thesis (Spring of 2016), there are two
experiments which are actively taking data from collisions produced by RHIC: The
Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction Experiment (PHENIX,
Section~\ref{sec:PHENIX}, Figure~\ref{fig:phenix_and_star}), and the Solenoidal
Tracker at RHIC (STAR, Figure~\ref{fig:phenix_and_star}). STAR and PHENIX are
complimentary to each other - PHENIX has a very high precision centrally
covering Electromagnetic Calorimeter, and other high precision detectors, but
lacks full kinematic coverage, whereas STAR has lower precision, but has nearly
full kinematic coverage around the beam intersection at its center.

RHIC's luminosity and beam polarization has been continuously improving
(Figure~\ref{fig:rhic_luminosity}) since RHIC was first turned on. As we will
discuss later (\ref{sec:forward_upgrade}), this increased luminosity observed in
2013, was maximally leveraged with upgrades to the PHENIX detector.

RHIC accelerates ions in a multi-stage process, summarized in
Figure~\ref{fig:rhic_complex}. The first stop is the \textbf{Electron Beam Ion
Source}, built on top of a $200 MeV$ linear accelerator (Linac). Once ions are
injected into the Linac, they travel to the $Booster Synchrotron$.  At this
stage, ions are accelerated with pulsed RF fields. Once the beam of ions has
been accelerated to nearly the speed of light, they are fed into the
\textbf{Alternating Gradient Synchrotron} or AGS. At this time, ions are
traveling at about 0.37~$c$. By the time the ions leave the AGS, they are moving
at 0.997~$c$. Once the ions are ready, they are transferred to the
\textbf{AGS-to-RHIC Line}, where a switching magnet pumps bunches of ions into
either the counterclockwise circulating ring of RHIC, or the clockwise
circulating ring of RHIC. The ions are 'spun-up' here to maximum speed, and are
accelerated around the RHIC complex - each beam-ion travels nearly 2.4 miles in
microseconds, for the duration of a physics-fill~\cite{RHIC2016}.

When the RHIC rings are filled with ions, the ions are bunched into rotating
electromagnetic potentials called 'buckets'. There are 360 beam-buckets in
total, but typically only a fraction are filled with ions. For this analysis, we
took data with beams with 110 filled buckets. The sequence of beam buckets from
one bunch to the next is referred to as a 'bunch' - and are rather long -
Figure~\ref{fig:bunch_profile_overlay}. A detailed presentation of beam dynamics
with regards to luminosity will be presented in chapter
\ref{ch:vernier_analysis}.

    a 40 nanosecond time period. Even with bunches crossing a fixed point over
    40 nanoseconds, this still corresponds to an overall bunch length of about
    12 meters. Conversely, the bunch width is quite narrow - with Gaussian
    geometry, it is between 150 millimeters and 300 millimeters depending on the
    beam energy. Understanding the beam bunch geometry is a crucial component to
    understanding total the total luminosity delivered by RHIC to PHENIX.

\section{Production of Polarized Proton Beams}

The production of polarized beams is crucial to the physics of this measurement
- without polarized beams, no spin structure analysis can be done at RHIC. This
is due to the fact that the helicity state of the protons in the initial state
of any proton proton collision can be connected to the final observed states in
a way which provides information about the spin structure function, as was
discussed in section \ref{ch:modeling_proton_spin}. 

The production of polarized beams is a multistage process, and involves several
experimental components. The importance of polarizing the beams is fully
realized once polarized beams are collided at relatively high center of mass
energies - where the beams behave less like polarized proton beams, but more
like polarized beams of quarks and gluons \cite{Alekseev2003}.  Beam
polarization is achieved incrementally - with polarization starting as soon as
the booster and AGS stage of the acceleration process \ref{fig:rhic_complex}.

The RHIC Configuration Manual \cite{RHIC2006} provides a wealth of information,
accelerator physics, diagrams, equations, and descriptions of the extremely
precise and comprehensive approach to creating polarized proton beams and
injecting them into RHIC. This work was crucial to this section of my thesis,
and is recommended reading for anyone who wishes to know 'all the details' of
how RHIC handles polarized beams.

\subsection{Polarized Injection}

RHIC uses an optically pumped polarized ion source (OPPIS),
Figure~\ref{fig:rhic_oppis} to produce a polarized ion source greatly in excess
of RHIC's design intensity. This is used to our advantage, as the emittance of
the beam can be lowered to create a highly collimated beam for physics use.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  }
  \label{fig:rhic_polarized_beam_line}
\end{figure}

Once ions have been optically pumped, we have a direct-current beam at
approximately 80\% polarization. The pumping is accomplished using Rubidium
vapor. The polarized ions are then moved into the booster from the Linac, where
some polarization is lost to spin precession, intrinsic to accelerating charged
ions in a circular path. However, polarization is maintained, for the most part,
by matching the precession resonance to the orbiting frequency of the booster
ring. The Siberian snakes and spin rotators at this stage serve to incrementally
flip the ion spin such that the natural depolarization works to re-polarize the
orbiting ions, every full-turn. The full details of this procedure are well
described in \cite{RHIC2006}.

After the ions are sufficiently polarized and filled in the AGS, they are moved
into the AGS to RHIC Transfer line, Figure~\ref{fig:ags_to_rhic}. The beam is
focused and fed through a switching magnet - which must be timed with great
precision in order to fill the blue and yellow beams with the appropriate
polarization patters. In fact, the precision is so great, that the earth's
curvature must be taken into account over this relatively short injection line -
the entry point and exit point are bent ever slow slightly different - the entry
being 12.51 mrad, vs the egress being 12.46 mrad \cite{RHIC2006}. At the point
of injection in the transfer line, the beam size and emittance are measured, as
well as the beam polarization.

\section{Maintaining Beam Polarization}

The creation of polarized beams is only half the battle. Depolarizing resonances
in any particle beam are intrinsic in the design of any circulating beam
particle accelerator - without intervention, after a few rotations, RHIC's
polarized beams would be unpolarized. RHIC uses several strategies in concert to
correct for the largest of these depolarizing resonances - including beam orbit
corrections, the Siberian Snakes, Betatron Tune Spreading, and sextupole
magnetic depolarizing resonances. 

\subsection{Siberian Snakes and Spin Rotators}

The Siberian Snakes are positioned at two locations on the RHIC ring (as well as
others along the injection sequence). The most stable configuration of spin
injected in RHIC is such that the spin axis is perpendicular to the plane of the
accelerator ring. The Siberian snake is a helical magnet which forces the spin
to rotate 180 degrees every half rotation. This special configuration of snakes
(see Figure~\ref{fig:rhic_complex}) ingeniously takes advantage of the
rotational precision of the spin (a depolarizing resonance) to re-polarize the
beam, every half-orbit.

The spin rotators are located outside of experimental interaction regions around
PHENIX and STAR. These special dipole magnets rotate the spin of the beams onto
a longitudinal (parallel with beam) axis - these magnets are important for any
measurement (such as this one) requiring longitudinal spin polarization.
Otherwise, transverse spin effects can by studied.

\subsection{Measuring Beam Polarization}

The RHIC Collider-Accelerator Department provides several means of measuring the
beam polarization over the course of the data taking period. PHENIX takes
special data and studies it, to determine the real beam polarization delivered
to the detector, in a yearly analysis (for years where polarized data is taken).
This analysis is often called "Local Polarimetry", but is often abbreviated as
LPol in PHENIX logs.

CAD will additionally measure polarization in via inelastic proton-carbon
scattering in the Coulomb-Nuclear Interference (CNI) region. Relative
polarization can be determined with to within 10\% in only a few seconds of
measurement. 

Vertical polarization is determined through the calculation of the left and
right particle production, with a known analyzing power (\cite{RHIC2006}, Ch 8):

\begin{equation}
  P_B = {{1}\over{A_p}}{{N_L-N_R}\over{N_L+N_R}}
  \label{eq:rhic_polarization}
\end{equation}

Where $P_B$ is the beam polarization, $N_L$ and $N_R$ are the left-scattering
produced particles, and right-scattering produced particles and $A_p$ is the
analyzing power, which can be calculated from first principals, and
experimentally verified. Scattering takes place as a carbon filament is swept
across the beam.
