I am indebted to my advisor, Ken Barish, whose calm, stoic and unabated support
helped guide me through my research. Ken's advising style allowed me the
freedom to pursue my own interests while keeping centered on scientific goals.

During my time at Brookhaven National Lab, I was mentored by many inspirational
scientists and graduate students. Josh Perry taught me everything I know about
PHENIX data acquisition. Martin Leitgab taught me the value of patience and
tenacity when solving an intractable problem. Martin Purschke showed me the
value of a sense of humor, even in stressful situations. Chris Pinkenburg
demonstrated the advantage of doing things the right way, the first time.

Without Joe Seele, I would have never compiled a single line of code - his
introduction to Makefiles and the wider world of computer science has been
invaluable. 

Richard Hollis has been a role model of persisance, patience, and good humor--he
helped me edit this thesis, and always seemed to carve out time from his
busy schedule to give me personalized attention.

Oleg Eyser pushed me to be the best graduate student possible. Even when I
wanted to give up or just `get the right answer', he did not lower his
standards.

The team of researchers who carried out the `W Analysis' with me comprise some
of the most helpful and talented people I've ever worked with. Daniel Jumper
has been my comrade in analysis since the beginning. Ralf Seidl has provided a
constant cross check and push to improve. Francesca Giordano made time to
explain even the simple things patiently to me, and guided me in my first foray
into hardware assembly, with the RPCs. Along with Sangwha Park, Abraham Meles,
Ciprean Gal, Chong Kim, and Hideyuki Oide, the W Analysis team has supported
all aspects of this analysis with cross-checks, expert advice, and clearly
written analysis notes and theses.

Angelika Drees and Amaresh Datta were both instrumental in directing and
discussing my progress with the `Vernier Analysis'.

I must also acknowlege my dear friends who have supported me emotionally
throughout graduate school. Chris Heidt, Behnam Sarvestani, Pat Odenthal, Oleg
Martynov, Corey Kownacki, Jackie Hubbard, Alex Natale-Anderson, and the
DeGroots--I couldn't have done this without you guys.

Thank you to my mother and father, Bob and Marian, who always made time to
support my various interests, and encouraged me to find my own way. They never
once tried to force me onto one path, over another, and instead, gave me
unconditional love, and the tools to become successful.  Thank you to my two
brothers, Joe and David, who have always had my back--I don't think anyone can
ask for a better family than mine.  Thank you to Emily, who put up with me when
I was the worst, and helped me be at my best.
