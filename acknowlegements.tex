As may become apparent in this thesis, you will note that I have a tendendancy
to go on at length. In my first draft, I attempted to acknowlege every mentor,
scientist and friend who has ever helped me. Instead of attempting this
impossible task, I will instead, highlight the most important contributions to
my development over the course of this work, both academically and personally.
 
Advisors and mentors are some of the most important people one can encounter.
Time and again, I have heard colleagues speak of ``that one inspirational''
person that drove them to be their best, helped them grow personally and
professionally. In that regard, I suffer an embarassment of riches.

I am indebted to my advisor, Ken Barish, whose calm, stoic and unabated support
helped guide me through my research. Ken's advising style allowed me the
freedom to pursue my own interests while keeping centered on scientific goals.
Ken believed in me, and this vote of confidence spurred me on to success in
graduate school.

During my time at Brookhaven National Lab, I was mentored by many inspirational
scientists and graduate students. Josh Perry taught me everything I know about
PHENIX data acquisition. Martin Leitgab taught me the value of patience and
tenacity when solving an intractable problem. Martin Purschke showed me the
value of a sense of humor, even in stressful situations. Chris Pinkenburg
demonstrated the advantage of doing things the right way, the first time.

Joe Seele, without you, I would have never compiled a single line of code -
your introduction to Makefiles and the wider world of computer science has been
invaluable. 

Richard Hollis has been a role model of persisance, patience, and good humor -
he helped me edit this thesis, and always seemed to carve out time from his
busy schedule to give me personalized attention.

Oleg Eyser, you pushed me to be the best graduate student possible. Even when I
wanted to give up or just `get the right answer', you did not relent. Thank you.

The team of researchers who carried out the `W Analysis' with me comprise some
of the most helpful and talented people I've ever worked with. Daniel Jumper
has been my comrade in analysis since the beginning. Ralf Seidl has provided a
constant cross check and push to improve. Francesca Giordano made time to
explain even the simple things patiently to me, and guided me in my first foray
into hardware assembly, with the RPCs. Along with Sangwha Park, Abraham Meles,
Ciprean Gal, Chong Kim, and Hideyuki Oide, the W Analysis team has supported
all aspects of this analysis with cross-checks, expert advice, and clearly
written analysis notes and theses. I have extensively relied on Cip and Hide's
theses in my own analysis of the theoretical physics presented in Chapter 3,
and have relied on the rest of the W-Analysis team's input for Chapters 5, 6
and 7. 

Angelika Drees and Amaresh Datta were both instrumental in directing and
discussing my progress with the `Vernier Analysis'.

I must also acknowlege my dear friends who have supported me emotionally
throughout graduate school. Chris Heidt, Behnam Sarvestani, Pat Odenthal, Oleg
Martynov, Corey Kownacki, Jackie Hubbard, and Alex Natale-Anderson - you are my
second family, and I am grateful for your unabated supported in good times and
bad. 

Thank you to my mother and father, Bob and Marian, who always made time to
support my various interests, and encouraged me to find my own way. They never
once tried to force me onto one path, over another, and instead, gave me
unconditional love, and the tools to become successful.  Thank you to my two
brothers, Joe and David, who have always had my back, and have always been
ready to support me, no matter what.  Thank you to my girlfriend, Emily, who
gracefully dealt with the brunt of the stress that comes with finalizing
graduate school and changing careers.  I'm sure you all have been on the
receving end of an uncountable number of miseries inflicted by my stressed-self
during the rigors of graduate school, yet you've all stuck with me, and loved
me. Thank you.

Finally, though I have certainly failed in my attempt to acknowledge everyone
that has made a positive impact on my life, know that I am only the man I am
today, because I have met an incredible multitude of people willing to guide,
mentor, and grow me.
